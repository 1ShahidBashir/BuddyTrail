# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment
As contributors and maintainers of this project, we are dedicated to making our community a harassment-free environment for everyone, inclusive of all backgrounds. We recognize and celebrate diversity in age, body type, disabilities (whether visible or invisible), ethnicity, gender identity, experience level, education, socio-economic background, nationality, appearance, race, religion, sexual orientation, and more.

We strive to create a safe and welcoming space for all participants.

## Expected Behavior

Here are examples of positive behaviors that contribute to a healthy, inclusive community:

- Using kind, welcoming language that includes everyone.
- Respecting diverse perspectives and experiences.
- Taking feedback constructively and with an open mind.
- Working with a focus on what benefits the community.
- Showing compassion and understanding to others.
- Examples of unacceptable actions include, but are not limited to:

- Using sexualized language or imagery, or engaging in inappropriate sexual attention or advances.
- Insults, derogatory remarks, and personal or political attacks.
- Harassing others, either publicly or privately.
- Revealing others' personal information (such as addresses) without their consent.
- Any conduct that would be deemed unprofessional in a work environment.

## Our Duties
It is the responsibility of project maintainers to outline and enforce standards of behavior. They are empowered to take action when community guidelines are violated.

Maintainers may delete, modify, or reject comments, commits, code, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. Additionally, they have the authority to ban individuals (temporarily or permanently) whose behavior is threatening, harmful, or inappropriate.

## Scope of Application
This Code of Conduct applies in all areas related to the project, including public interactions where someone is representing the project or its community. This could include, for example, using an official project email address, posting on social media, or acting as a project representative at events.

## Reporting and Enforcement
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project team at **[shreyadwivedi9839@gmail.com]**. All reports will be handled promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of those who report incidents.

## Guidelines for Enforcement
In cases of violations of this Code of Conduct, project maintainers will follow these steps to determine consequences:

1. Correction: The individual will receive a written notice explaining the violation. No further action will be taken if the behavior improves.

2. Warning: If a violation occurs again, a warning will be issued. Further violations may lead to more serious consequences.

3. Temporary Ban: If violations continue, the individual may be temporarily banned from the community, with a clear explanation of how long the ban will last.

4. Permanent Ban: For repeated offenses or severe violations, the individual may be permanently removed from the community.

By following this Code of Conduct, we aim to create a supportive, respectful, and inclusive environment where everyone can contribute and collaborate freely.
